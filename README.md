*** MINDBLOOM – After-School Classes App (Frontend) ***

Student: Mohamed Esokni
Module: CST3144 – Full Stack Software App Development
Coursework: CW1 (Individual) – Frontend

*** Project Overview ***

For this coursework I built a Vue.js app where students and parents can browse different after-school lessons and activities. You can look through them, sort them, and even "purchase" them (well, pretend to anyway).

The frontend connects to a backend I made with Express.js, and all the data gets stored in MongoDB Atlas through a REST API.
